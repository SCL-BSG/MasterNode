Bank Society Coin Gold is a free open source decentralized project forked from Bitcoin.

NOTE : UBUNTU 20.04 update, no longer available with UBUNTU 18.04 (now EOL)

It's an experimental project with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
You're using this software with no guarantees or warranty of any kind. Use it at your own risk!
Built on the foundations of Bitcoin, Litecoin, PeerCoin, NovaCoin, CraveProject, Dash Masternodes
XUVCoin, BATA, and Crypostle to help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Adjustments based on network hashrate, previous block difficulty simulating real bullion mining: If the difficulty rate is low; using excessive work to produce low value blocks does not yield large return rates. When the ratio of difficulty adjusts and the network hashrate remains constant or declines: The reward per block will never go higher than 2 coins per block. It's much more profitable to stake in wallets using Proof of Stake.

This algorithm is intended to discourage >51% attacks, or malicous miners. It will also act as an automatic inflation adjustment based on network conditions.

Misc Features:

Society includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified implementation to work with the Society codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument. It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.
